# CC Inclusive Cross Section Example for MINERvA 101 2021
An example of a charged current (CC) inclusive cross section analysis using the MINERvA Analysis Toolkit (MAT).  Starts from the official MINERvA data preservation "anaTuple" .root files, produced by MasterAnaDev (MAD), and produces all histograms needed to extract a cross section.  The basic tutorial does not attempt to constrain backgrounds with sidebands.  Based on Ben Messerly's examples of using the MINERvA Analysis Toolkit and work by Mehreen Sultana on her thesis analysis.

The instructions below are being updated to better serve use with MINERvA's Open Data Product (minerva.fnal.gov/opendata). Please rely on the wiki for documentation at this time.

## Installation Instructions
**First** try [the wiki instructions](https://github.com/MinervaExpt/MINERvA-101-Cross-Section/wiki/Installation/#installing_the_whole_minerva_101_2021_tutorial) for a comprehensive guide to the dependencies as well as this package.  If that file no longer exists, you'll have to install the [dependencies](#Dependencies) yourself and follow the instrutions below.

**In case the wiki instructions aren't available:**
1. Install [dependencies](#Dependencies)
2. Make a working directory.  Mine is called `MINERvA101_2021/`
3. Download the complete source from [MinervaExpt](https://github.com/MinervaExpt/MAT_IncPions): `git clone https://github.com/MinervaExpt/MINERvA-101-Cross-Section.git #Makes a src subdirectory for you`
4. Make a build directory: `mkdir opt && cd opt && mkdir build && cd build #opt for optimized build as opposed to debug build`
5. Run cmake to generate a build system: ``cmake ../../src -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`pwd`/.. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release``
   If `cmake` fails talking about dependencies, you may have to manually point to them with command line arguments like `-DPlotUtils_DIR=/path/to/PlotUtilsInstallPrefix/lib`
6. Compile and install: `make install`

## Usage
```
runEventLoop <dataPlaylist.txt> <mcPlaylist.txt>

*** Explanation ***
Reduce MasterAnaDev AnaTuples to event selection histograms to extract a
single-differential inclusive cross section for the 2021 MINERvA 101 tutorial.

*** The Input Files ***
Playlist files are plaintext files with 1 file name per line.  Filenames may be
xrootd URLs or refer to the local filesystem.  The first playlist file's
entries will be treated like data, and the second playlist's entries must
have the "Truth" tree to use for calculating the efficiency denominator.

*** Output ***
Produces a single runEventLoop.root file with all histograms needed for the
ExtractCrossSection program also built by this package.  You'll need a
.rootlogon.C that loads ROOT object definitions from PlotUtils to access
systematics information from these files.

*** Return Codes ***
0 indicates success.  All histograms are valid only in this case.  Any other
return code indicates that histograms should not be used.  Error messages
about what went wrong will be printed to stderr.  So, they'll end up in your
terminal, but you can separate them from everything else with something like:
"runEventLoop data.txt mc.txt 2> errors.txt"
```
